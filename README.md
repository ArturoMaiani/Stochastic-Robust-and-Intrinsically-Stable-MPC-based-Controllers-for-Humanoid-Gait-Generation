# Stochastic-Robust-and-Intrinsically-Stable-MPC-based-Controllers-for-Humanoid-Gait-Generation

In presence of disturbances, the performance of MPC-based controllers
typically deteriorates, possibly leading to constraint violation. In the case of humanoid gait generation,
this can cause the loss of dynamic balance and internal instability with the subsequent fall of the robot.

The objective of this report is to implement a Stochastic-MPC-based gait generation algorithm for
humanoids which is able to guarantee robustness in presence of disturbances.
Such algorithm is compared with a nominal IS-MPC and a Robust MPC.

The designed method is validated through dynamic
simulations on the ROBOTIS OP-3 humanoid in Matlab.
